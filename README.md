# Web Scraping Quotes

This Python script demonstrates a simple web scraping project using the `requests` library to fetch data from [http://quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com). The script uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML content and extracts quotes along with their authors.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-quotes.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd web-scraping-quotes
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python scrape_quotes.py
    ```

4. View the scraped quotes in the console.
